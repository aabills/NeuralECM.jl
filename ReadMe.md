## NeuralECM.jl -- Project for Venkat's class

To install, please first add the AlecRegistry. From the Julia Pkg prompt, enter `registry add https://github.com/abillscmu/AlecRegistry`. Otherwise it will error when you install the rest of the package.

`src` contains only the main project file, which just defines a few small functions to help you with OCV's. Other than that, it's on you. I've installed all the packages you will need to complete the project.
